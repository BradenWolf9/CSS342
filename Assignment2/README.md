# TimeSpan

One warning is generated by clang-tidy, this is about converting the hours
minutes and seconds into int while calculating totalSeconds.
totalSeconds is has modulo used on it which can only be done on ints, so it
has to be an int.

limitaions:
hours can go to two decimal places
minutes can go to one decimal place
seconds can't have any decimals

Goals: Understanding operator overloading

Design and implement TimeSpan class which represents a duration in hours,
minutes and seconds.
```$xslt
Displayed       Meaning
2:12:07         2 hours, 12 minutes, 7 seconds
-0:10:43        Minus 10 minutes and 43 seconds
```

The seconds and minutes have to be between 0 and 59.
The hours can be 0 to any number.
The constructor for TimeSpan can take 0, 1, 2, or 3 parameters.
In addition to integer value, the constructor should also be able to handle double values and convert them as accurately as possible

```$xslt
TimeSpan(1.5, -10, 93)	same as 1:21:33
TimeSpan(1.5)		    same as 1:30:00
```

## Compile and Run

```
# quick compile for testing
g++ -g -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -Wno-sign-compare *.cpp

# comprehensive tests
./create-output.sh > output.txt 2>&1
```
